A simple turn-based game.
It allows us to build buildings and collect money.
The game shows my approach to the MVVM model and skills in WPF.
The graphics used in the game come mainly from flaticon.com

The game in the initial version was created for the completion of the subject and is now refactoring to the MVVM model.
In the near future I will add some code and description here.
